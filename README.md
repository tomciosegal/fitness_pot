    - The project uses **HTML** to create the basic elements and content of my app.
- [**CSS**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS3)
    - The project uses **CSS** to apply the custom styles created with **SCSS** to my app. The base.html file is linked directly to the main.min.css stylesheet.
- [**Bootstrap**](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - The project uses the **Bootstrap** framework to add a responsive grid system, prebuilt components, plugins built on jQuery, and Bootstrap styles to my app, before adding my custom styles.
- [**jQuery**](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **jQuery** as the primary JavaScript functionality. This is both the standard jQuery that is built with Materialize components, and my custom jQuery used in my script.js file.
- [**Python**](https://www.python.org/)
    - The project uses **Python** as the back-end programming language for my app.
- [**PyMongo**](https://api.mongodb.com/python/current/)
    - The project uses **PyMongo** as the Python API for MongoDB. This API enables linking the data from the back-end database to the front-end app.
- [**Flask**](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/)
    - The project uses **Flask**, which is a Python microframework.
- [**Jinja**](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.10.x/)
    - The project uses **Jinja** for templating with Flask in the HTML code. I used **Jinja** to simplify my HTML code, avoid repetition, and allow simpler linking of the back-end to the front-end.
- [**MongoDB**](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)
    - The project uses **MongoDB** to store the database in the cloud. The information displayed in the front-end app is pulled from the database store.

# **5. Mockups

[Wireframes](https://github.com/tomciosegal/fitness_pot/tree/master/wireframes) 
for the Fitness Pot can be found in separate folder called wireframes.

# **6. Version Control

- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/)
    - I've used **Git** as a version control system to regularly add and commit changes made to project in Gitpod, before pushing them to GitHub.
- [**GitHub**](https://github.com/)
    - I've used **GitHub** as a remote repository to push and store the committed changes to my project from Git.

# **6.1 Hosting

- [**Heroku**](https://www.heroku.com/)
    - I've used **Heroku** as the hosting platform to deploy my app.

# **7. TESTING**

- I used Google Chrome's Development tools to constantly test each change that I<br/> 
made to my project and to ensure that it appeared in the desired way on different screen sizes. <br/>
- I also tested my app on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet and desktop) to ensure <br/>
it appeared in the desired way on different devices.
- I also wrote automated test for validators.py file. Test is located in tests.py file.
- I continually  tested code in the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
    in order to get rid of errors. 
- Vocabulary and grammar was checked on [Spell checker](http://www.reverso.net/spell-checker/english-spelling-grammar/)

Image available  in wireframes.



ERRORS:
/favicon.ico:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()- the only one that comes in console.

## **7.1 Code Validation

- I used the [W3C HTML Validator tool](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) to validate my HTML code.
    - The W3C Validator tool doesn't recognise the Jinja templating, which has resulted in it showing a lot of errors in relation to the Jinja code. However, all other code is validating fine.
- I used the [W3C CSS Validator tool](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) to validate my CSS code.
- I used the [Pep8 Online tool](http://pep8online.com/) to validate my Python syntax.
- I used CLI to sort all my imports by using command  "isort -rc ."
- I used CLI to make sure line length is not going above 79 in one line by using command  "black --line-length=79"
- I used CLI to check all the errors in the code by using command  "flake8"

## ** 7.2 Pagination Test (manual)

1. Test the pagination page by page and verify that the same amoutn of recipes are always appearing on the same page number
2. Test the pagination next / previous page functionality and verify that the same recipes are always appearing on the same page number
3. Test the 'next' button to check if disappear  on last page, and 'prevoius' button if disappear  on first page.
